# Unity-Ml-Agents-Training-Lab-Archive
This repository is the storage of the Unity project I created for my Diploma Thesis. The data was retrieved using a Google Colab.
More specifically the Colab accessed the data in the repository and after hours of training via Machine Learning Algorithms it returned the requested results.

I keep this repository as an archive and as a memory of all the hard work I've put into this thesis.
